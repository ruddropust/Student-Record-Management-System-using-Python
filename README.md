# Student Record Management System (CLI) - Python
A robust, lightweight Command-Line Interface (Interface) application built with Python for managing student databases. This project was developed as a practice in core Python fundamentals, focusing on data persistence, input validation, and object-oriented design.

## 🚀 Features
- Functionality: Add, Update, View, Delete and search student records.

- Data Persistence: Records are saved in a students_db.json file, ensuring data isn't lost when the program closes.

- Persistent Validation Loops: The system "waits" for correct input (e.g., valid email formats, numeric CGPA) rather than crashing on errors.

- Dynamic Sorting: View all students automatically sorted by Roll Number.

- Regex Validation: Strict email verification using Regular Expressions to ensure data integrity.

- Safety Confirmations: Specialized "Press Enter" or "y/n" confirmation prompts to prevent accidental data deletion.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- Language: Python 3.x

- Storage: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

- Libraries: json, os, re (Standard libraries only; no external dependencies required).
